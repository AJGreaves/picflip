## UX

### Project Goals

The primary goal of PicFlip! is to provide a clean, intuative and child friendly game to entertain and delight it's users.
PicFlip! has two target audiences: Pre-school children and their parents. 

#### Player goals

The central target audience for this game are pre-school children aged 1 to 5 years old.

**Players goals are:**
- Child friendly controls.
- Large buttons and clickable areas for young fingers to operate.
- All game controls laid out together and in an intuative way. 
- Fun images and sounds. 
- Visual and audio rewards while playing.

#### Parental goals

As parents of pre-school children have a large amount of say about what games their children are exposed to, 
parental needs must also be at the forfront of any project designed for children in this age group. 

**Parents goals are:**
- Usability for the range of abilties in pre-school kids.
- A visiualy appealing, well functioning game. 
- The ability to for parent to reset the stored player profile. 
- A mute button.

#### Developer/Buinsess Goals

- Well thought out programming that prepares for a child's random and unpredictable use of PicFlip! 
For example, that the game cannot be broken by clicking many areas quickly, or if it is restarted at an unexpected moment. 
- A professional looking first dip into the world of using JavaScript, jQuery and Jasmine. 
- A project the developer is excited to make a part of her portfolio. 

#### User Stories

**Players goals are:**
As a player, I want:
- The ability to easily find and understand the controls for the game, so that I can operate them easily. 
- A large easy to press buttons and controls, so that my young fingers can use them easily on all devices.
- Audio and/or visual feedback when I play the game, so that I know when I have clicked or not clicked something.
- The ability to choose from cards with my favourite childrens characters on, so that I am even more engaged in finding them in the game.
- Postitive audio feedback when I complete a step in the game (for example when I find a matching pair of cards), because this increases my enjoyment from playing.
- Visual symbols and images that I recoginise, so that I understand when I have achiveved something in the game. For example stars out of five, and a trophy for high score.
- The ability to see my old scores if I return to the game, so I can try to beat them.


#### Parental goals

As parents of pre-school children have a large amount of say about what games their children are exposed to, 
parental needs must also be at the forfront of any project designed for children in this age group. 

**Parents goals are:**
As a parent of a player, I want:
- Levels of difficulty for my child to choose from, so that they are engaged for longer and the game is useable for a wider age range.
- A visually and operationally appealing game, so that I also have a positive expeience when using it with my child.
- The ability to delete a stored profile, so that I can reset the game for another go, or for another child. 
- The option to delete a profile to be easy for me to find, but not easy for a child who is randomly pressing buttons to access, so that a profile is not deleted by accident.
- A mute button to be included, so that the sounds can be switched off when they become annoying. (If only the actual child came with one of those too!).

## Features
 
### Existing Features

------
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.
- http://www.convertcsv.com/csv-to-json.htm


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
